## Overview ðŸ”Ž

Welcome to **Penn Course Cart**! Penn Course Cart is a _responsive_ React app designed built with TypeScript designed to help students look for and select CIS courses at Penn. The app has information for each course in the CIS department, including but not limited to course code, cross-listings, description, as well as information specific to the current semester, such as current instructor and meeting times for each section (note that this information is sourced from two locations: 1) `src/components/data/courses.json` and 2) the Penn Labs API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/pennlabs/labs-api-server)).

## How To Use Penn Course Cart ðŸ›’

To see information for a particular course, click on the box to make it expand. Add the course to your cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" at the bottom of the course.

Use the search bar to filter for courses that match a particular keyword. The app will then perform a _case-insensitive_ search on the information listed under all courses.

Click the "View Cart" button in the the top right corner to view the courses you have added to your cart. To rank courses in your cart, simply drag and drop to rearrange them in your cart. To delete courses, click the "x" located on the right side of the course. Once you've selected all the courses you would like, click "Checkout" at the bottom of the course cart to be redirected to your Penn Course Cart receipt.
